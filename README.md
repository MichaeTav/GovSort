# GovSort
GovSort was my final project for my political science class. We were tasked with creating a project that reflects what we have learned throughout the semester. So I decided to make a game about sorting the different topics we learned. The topics include: presidents, supreme court cases, amendments, and general U.S. history. I wanted to make something that was fun and easy to play. You can test it out [here](https://www.govsort.com/)

# How to Play
1. You begin by selecting from the 4 topics. Each topic card will show your highscore, total number of cards that need to be sorted, and the difficulty.
2. You start by placing the first card from the top of the deck and place the following cards in their correct order depending on the topic.
3. There is only 1 life so if you make a mistake it is game over.

# Controls
If you are on a computer you can either use the on screen controls or use `s` or `←` to move left and `d` or `→` to move right. Cards can be placed using the onscreen button or with either `SPACE` or `ENTER`.

# Installation
To run this on your local machine you can follow these steps:
    
1. Download the code using `git clone https://github.com/MichaeTav/GovSort.git`
2. Navigate to the directory where the project was downloaded `cd GovSort` and install the required packages using `npm install`

4. Run the app using `npm run dev`
5. Go to the provided local url in your browser.
